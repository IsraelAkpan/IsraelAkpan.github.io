I am new to GitHub. I am a University Student interested in MEG (MagnetoEncephaloGraphy), which is the study of brains based on the acquisition of the magnetic effects of brain activity in the vicinity of the space around, by equipment that are designed to be extremely sensitive to electromagnetic disturbances.
